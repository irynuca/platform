Aquila Part Prod Com SA, founded in 1994, is a leading player in Romania's fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, specializing in distribution, logistics, and transportation. The company generates its primary revenue through FMCG distribution, which accounts for over 90% of its income, complemented by logistics and transport services. Its portfolio includes both own brands (e.g., Gradena and LaMasă) and globally recognized products. Aquila operates across Romania, Moldova, and Hungary, serving retail chains, traditional stores, HoReCa, and online platforms via an extensive network of over 72,000 points of sale.

The company’s cash generation is driven by its efficient supply chain solutions and growing focus on own-brand sales. Recent growth has been fueled by strategic acquisitions like Parmafood and Kitax Kft. Challenges include rising operational costs and competitive pressures. Listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange in November 2021 (symbol AQ), Aquila aims to sustain growth through regional expansion and digitalization initiatives.
